## Help Us Give Land Back, While Bringing Together Communities, With a Negative-Carbon Footprint

### Introduction
This project envisions a sustainable alternative to traditional capitalistic practices in land and housing ownership. The primary goal is to utilize innovative crowdfunding strategies to finance the acquisition and development of land and housing units. The project's unique approach involves selling "time-shares" of housing units at a daily rate, generating sufficient funds for land purchase, construction, and infrastructure development. Ultimately, the project aims to return the land and its developed infrastructure to the indigenous peoples who originally inhabited it, ensuring a just and equitable transfer of property.

### Objectives
- Disrupt traditional capitalistic practices in real estate by advocating for community ownership and sustainability.
- Promote rural community living for better mental health and well-being, enhancing social connections and supporting environmental regeneration.
- Democratize land acquisition through an accessible crowdfunding model.
- Honor and preserve cultural heritage by returning the land to indigenous communities after 50 years.

### Project Details
- **Time-Share Model**: Housing units will be sold in 365 "shares," each corresponding to a day of the year.
- **Crowdfunding Strategy**: Pool resources from multiple small investors, allowing them to easily invest in real estate.

### Financial Plan

**Updated Financials**
- **Land Purchase Cost**: $300,000
- **Housing Construction Cost**: $20,000 per unit
- **Shared Infrastructure Cost**: $100,000

**Revenue Per Unit**
- **Share Price**: $200 per day-share
  - **Annual Revenue per Unit**: 365 days x $200/day = $73,000

**Calculation of Required Housing Units**
To determine the number of housing units needed to cover the total cost of land, housing, and shared infrastructure:

1. **Total Project Cost Calculation**:
   - Land Purchase: $300,000
   - Housing Construction: $20,000 per unit
   - Shared Infrastructure: $100,000

2. **Total Revenue per Housing Unit:**
   - Each housing unit generates: $73,000 annually

3. **Number of Housing Units Calculation (Formula)**:
   ```
   Total Project Cost = Land Cost + (Number of Units * Housing Cost) + Shared Infrastructure Cost
   Total Revenue = Number of Units * Revenue per Unit
   ```

**Break-even Calculation:**

   Simplifying:
   ```
   Number of Units = Total Project Cost / (Revenue per Unit - Housing Cost per Unit)
   ```

   Plug in the values:
   ```
   Number of Units = ($300,000 + $100,000) / ($73,000 - $20,000)
   Number of Units = $400,000 / $53,000
   Number of Units = 7.55
   ```

Since the number of housing units must be a whole number, round up to:

```
Number of Units = 8
```

Thus, a minimum of 8 housing units are required to cover the costs of the land, housing, and shared infrastructure, given the updated parameters.

### Simplified Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Foundational Planning
   - **Engage with Indigenous Communities**: Ensure their needs and preferences are integrated into the project.
   - **Set up Crowdfunding Campaign**: Choose a suitable crowdfunding platform and prepare the campaign materials.
   - **Secure Initial Permits and Legal Documentation**: Obtain necessary approvals for land and housing development.

#### Phase 2: Crowdfunding Campaign
   - **Launch Campaign**: Target ethical investors and the broader community.
   - **Market the Campaign**: Utilize social media, press releases, and community events to generate interest.

#### Phase 3: Land Acquisition and Development
   - **Purchase Land**: Use the raised funds to acquire the targeted land.
   - **Begin Construction**: Start building the housing units and common infrastructure.

#### Phase 4: Community Building
   - **Promote Rural Living**: Organize activities and workshops to strengthen community bonds.
   - **Integrate Local Economy**: Partner with local businesses and cooperatives to foster economic integration.

#### Phase 5: Transition and Sustainability
   - **Plan for Land Transfer**: Develop a roadmap for transferring land ownership back to the indigenous communities after 50 years.
   - **Ongoing Support**: Ensure continued community engagement and sustainability efforts.

### Conclusion
This concept note outlines a thoughtful and innovative approach to land ownership and community building, blending modern crowdfunding methods with traditional wisdom and sustainable living practices. Through careful planning and execution, this project aims to achieve long-term success by respecting the cultural heritage of indigenous communities and promoting sustainable and communal living.
